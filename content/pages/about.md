This blog is as a space to organize my thoughts and post tidbits of
random things I have been working on, primarily related to quantitative
finance, exploring data and using R and python.

Some other places I can be found on the internet include:

* [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1451311/mgilbert)

* [github](https://github.com/matthewgilbert)

A copy of my CV can be found [here]({filename}../pdfs/MatthewGilbert.pdf)
