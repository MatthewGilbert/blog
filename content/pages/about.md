Title: About

This blog will serve as a space to organize my thoughts and post tidbits of
random things I have been working on, primarily related to quantitative finance
using R and python.

A very mundane personal landing page with a collection of places I can be found
on the internet is available [here](www.matthewdgilbert.com)
