title: Fun with Docker

I've heard a bit about docker and figured it would be neat to play around with
but didn't really have anything specific in mind. The dependencies of this blog
have been increasing and I recently had to spend several hours debugging
things to get my site to generated, so I figured this was as good a time as any
to finally test out docker. I generate this blog with the python framework
pelican and a [plugin](https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb) which
allows me to generate content from jupyter notebooks. There is also another
interesting [plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/rmd_reader)
for incorporating .Rmd files, which I hope to take a look at at some point.
Since I'm using the anaconda python distribution I probably could have just
done something like

```language-bash
conda list --export > blog_reqs.txt
conda create -n blog --file blog_reqs.txt
```

and then built my blog using this conda environment, but if I move towards
creating some content in .Rmd files this solution would not address
dependency issues with R, plus I want to try docker!

As a side note, if you haven't heard of docker, there is an interesting talk
[here](https://puppetlabs.com/presentations/using-docker-puppet-james-turnbull-kickstarter)
to motivate its use and a nice introductory tutorial
[here](https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/31-introduction-to-docker).

I created a Dockerfile to generate my blog container that looks like

```language-bash
FROM debian:8.4

MAINTAINER Matthew Gilbert <matthew.gilbert12@gmail.com>

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    wget git bzip2 make vi

RUN mkdir -p /home/matthew/Projects

RUN echo 'export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH' > /etc/profile.d/conda.sh && \
    wget --quiet https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh && \
    /bin/bash /Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /opt/conda && \
    rm /Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

ENV PATH /opt/conda/bin:$PATH

RUN conda install markdown==2.6.6
RUN pip install pelican==3.6.3
```

Then to generate my blog I just build the container, start it up exposing a
port, build the static pages and serve them to the exposed port.

```language-bash
matthew@matthew-asus ~ $ docker build -t blog ~/Projects/dockers/blog/
matthew@matthew-asus ~ $ cd Projects/blog
matthew@matthew-asus ~ $ docker run -v $PWD:/tmp/working -w=/tmp/working -rm -itp 8000:8000 blog bash
root@79cc71ca90f1:/tmp/working# make html
pelican /tmp/working/content -o /tmp/working/output -s /tmp/working/pelicanconf.py 
Done: Processed 2 articles, 0 drafts, 1 page and 0 hidden pages in 1.38 seconds.
root@79cc71ca90f1:/tmp/working# make serve
cd /tmp/working/output && python -m pelican.server
```

From there I can inspect them from a web browser on the host at
`localhost:8000/` and if all looks good can deploy them to Github
for hosting.
